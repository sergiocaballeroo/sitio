        <h1>Information about NTN and GG in Networks</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>NTN (Non-Terrestrial Networks)</h2>
            <p>
                NTN refers to networks that operate beyond the terrestrial environment, including satellite, balloon, and unmanned aerial systems. These networks are designed to provide connectivity in areas where traditional terrestrial networks are unavailable or impractical.
            </p>
            <h3>Options and Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Satellites:</strong> Provide global coverage and can offer communication and data services in remote and rural areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Balloons:</strong> Can provide connectivity in specific areas and are often used for testing or in emergency situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles:</strong> Drones can provide temporary connectivity at events or in hard-to-reach areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Disaster Communication:</strong> NTN can be crucial for restoring communication after natural disasters.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>GG (Global Grid)</h2>
            <p>
                GG refers to the global network of distributed computing and storage known as the "Global Grid." It is an infrastructure that enables the sharing of computational and storage resources on a global scale.
            </p>
            <h3>Options and Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grid Computing:</strong> Allows users to access distributed computational resources globally for complex tasks and large-scale processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Distributed Storage:</strong> Provides a distributed storage system for managing and accessing large volumes of data from different locations.</li>
                <li><strong>Global Collaboration:</strong> Facilitates collaboration among researchers and organizations worldwide, allowing the sharing of resources and data.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The Global Grid infrastructure can scale to handle large workloads and adapt to user needs.</li>
